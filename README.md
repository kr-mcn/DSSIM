# DSSIM
DualSteer Simulator (DSSIM) is a simulation framework for core-network-level multi-access communication, known as DualSteer in 3GPP. This organization hosts simulation code used in our research, promoting reproducibility and enabling comparative studies on transport protocols, congestion control, and cross-layer design.
